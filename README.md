# DetectingDepression

Detecting depression is done by clinicians and there is lack of biological biomarkers. Detecting depression by using deep learning methods could be helpful for clinicians. We are trying to find good biomarkers from functional or structural MRI images. 

It is hard for clinicians to detect depression by just looking at MRI images. There are small amount of changes in anatomy or functioning of the brain that could be analyzed by mathematical measurments. The calculations could be done by using machine learning or deep learning methods.
